## Model Code

# SAM model for replicating Ogle et al, 2015

# We are looking into the effects of antecedent conditions on NPP
# namely precipitation received over the past five years and then the amount
# of precipitation received in the growing year within 4 classifications of
# rainfall events based on intensity
