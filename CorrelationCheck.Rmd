Today, I will perform some simple tests to confirm whether there is any correlation
between antecedent rainfall and temperature and GPP/NPP/NEE.

My methodology will be as below:

+ Propose a few methods of searching for correlations
+ Check my methods using Kiona's data (which we are fairly certain have these
correlations)
+ Use the methods on Var and Wkg FLUXNET data for NEE and GPP and see what we see!

***

# Data

First of all, let's load in the data.

```{r}

#Load Kiona's Data
Precip = read.table("data/dataset3.csv",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
NPP = read.table("data/dataset2.csv",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
NPP = NPP[,1:3]

#Prepare to load netcdf files for fluxnet sites
source("NCExtraction.R")

Var = NetCDFExtract("US-Var_2001-2014_FLUXNET2015")
Wkg = NetCDFExtract("US-Wkg_2005-2014_FLUXNET2015")
Ha1 = NetCDFExtract("US-Ha1_1992-2012_FLUXNET2015")

```
